                <hr>
                <p><strong>OneShot</strong> is one of the few games that have originality to it. Due to how it interact <br>
                with the user's computer to solve some hidden puzzles (not in-game), <br>
                it's what makes the game so damn special. Created on RPG Maker XP in 2014, <br>
                and released fully in 2016 by Future Cat LLC & Degica, the game introduces to the player <br>
                the main protagonist of the game, Niko, a cat-like child that wakes up on a mysterious world <br>
                that him/herself does not recognize it. On the beginning of the game, <br>
                Niko encounters a computer, known as The Wolrd Machine, that interacts with the player. <br>
                Upon exploring, Niko learns that he/she's the "Messiah" (Saviour of the World), <br>
                and can speak towards it's God (The Player/Us). The player's mission is to guide Niko and <br>
                bring the "Sun" of the World (represented as a lightbulp) to it's central tower, <br>
                resided to the Refuge city, to restore the light of the world.<br>
                The player guides Niko on the three areas (Barrens, Glen and Refuge) and upon reaching the tower,<br>
                the Machine once again interacts with the player, revealing that they can either Bring the Sun<br>
                to the top of the tower (trapping Niko), or break the sun and return Niko to it's homeworld <br>
                (thus destroying this world). <strong>But can you do both of them?</strong> Can you get a <strong>Better Ending?</strong><br>
                What's special about this game (like I said) is that, you need to do something that it's not in-game<br>
                to solve some puzzles, and also (since Niko and the World Machine can interact with the Player) <br>
                it's pretty obvious that the game <strong><u>BREAKS THE FORTH WALL</u></strong>, something that we don't see<br>
                that often on many videogames (like Max Payne, High on Life, The Stanley Parable, etc.).<br>
                <strong>OneShot: World Machine Edition</strong> was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2022.<br>
                Despite some cuts from the original game and added a PC-like UI for the puzzle parts,<br>
                it's still the same game, but played on another console!</p>
